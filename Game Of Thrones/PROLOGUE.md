# 第一章 《序幕》

> "we should start back," Gared urged as the woods began to grow dark around them

 "我们要回去了"看着逐渐被黑暗笼罩的森林，格雷德催促道

> "The wildlings are dead"

"这里的野人都已经死了"

> "Do the dead frighten you?" Ser Waymar Royce asked with just the hint of a smile.

"你被眼前的死人吓到了吗？"西尔带着一丝笑容问道

> Gared did not rise to the bait. He was an old man, past fifty,and he had seen the lordlings come andgo. "Dead is dead " he said. "We have no business with the dead"

格雷德并没有在意，他是一个年过半百,老人，而且他曾经看到过。"死了就是死了"，格雷德说道."和我们并没有关系"

> "Are the dead?" Royce Asked softly."what proof have we"

"真的都死了吗？" 西尔轻声问道."那我们拿什么证明呢?"

> "Will saw them" Gared said."If he says they are dead,that's proof enough for me"

"威尔见过他们" 格雷德说道 ,"如果他说他们都死了，那么对我来说这就已经足够了"

> Will had known they would drag him into the quarrel sooner or later.He wished it had been later rather than sooner."My mother told me that dead men sing no songs" he put in

威尔其实早就知道 他们的争吵迟早是要把他扯进来的.只是他希望发生的不要这么早，他的母亲曾经告诉过他"死人是不会唱歌的"他放下来说道

> "My wet nurse said the same thing,Will" Royce replied. "Never believe anything you hear at a woman's tit. There are things to be learned even from the dead." His voice echoed, too loud in the twilit forest

"我奶妈诉说着同样的事情，威尔"罗西答复道."永远不要相信你从女人那里听说到的任何事情.即便是已经死了的人,也是有可以学习的东西",他的声音有点大，回响在整个暮色森林

> "We have a long ride before us" Gared pointed out . "Eight days,maybe nine. And night isfalling"

"还有很漫长的路等着我们"格雷德打断了争吵。"或许是八天，也可能是九天，而且夜幕正在降临"

> Ser Waymar Royce glanced at the sky with disnterest. "It does that every day about this time .Are you unmanned by the dark Gared？"

西尔漫不经心的扫了一眼天空，"每天的这个点不都这样的吗.黑夜使你害怕了吗 格雷德?"

> Will could see the tightness around Gared's mouth, the barely suppressed anger in his eyes under the thick black hood of his cloak. Gared had spent forty years in the Night's Watch,man and boy, and he was not accustomed to begin made light of. yet it was more than that.Under the wounded pride,Will could sense something else in the older man.You could taste it; a nervous tension that came perilous close to fear.

威尔看到了格雷德紧闭着的嘴，他深吸一口气压制住了内心的怒火,但是在他那厚重的黑色兜帽下，还是能看到那愤怒的眼神。格雷德在守夜人里生活了四十余年，从一个懵懂的小孩成长到了一个明白世间道理的男人。然而，在多次经历生死下，更是不止于此。威尔可以感觉到这个老人身上其他的一些东西。你仿佛可以体会或者说感受品尝到到一种紧张和危险逼近的感觉。

> Will shared his unease. He had been four years on the Wall. The first time he had been sent beyond, all the old stories had come rushing back,and his bowels had turned to water. He had laughed about it afterward. He was a veteran of a hundred rangings by now, and the endless drak wilderness that the southron called the haunted forest had no more terrors for him.

威尔诉说着他的不安。 他在城里已经待了四年了，他第一次被指派到外面执行任务的时候，被那些古老的故事吓得赶紧回来，还吓得恶心呕吐。之后他对这件事都会一笑了之.

> Until tonight. Something was different tonight. There was an edge to this darkness that made his hackles rise. Nine days they had been riding, north and northwest and then north again, farther and farther from the wall , hard on the track of a band of Widling raiders. Each day had been worse than the day that had come before it . Today was the worst of all. A cold wind was blowing out of the north, and it made the trees rustle like living things. All day, Will had felt as though something were watching him, something cold and implacable that loved him not. Gared had felt it too. Will wanted nothing so much as to ride hellbent for the safety of the Wall, but that was not a feeling to share with your commander.
